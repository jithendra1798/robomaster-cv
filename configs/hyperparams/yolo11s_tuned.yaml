# YOLOv11s tuned hyperparameters
# Source: model.tune() 10 iterations, best at iteration 7
# Tuned on: mergeRM_v1, NYU server RTX 4090
# Date: 2025-02-13
# Note: lr0 and momentum were overridden by auto optimizer (AdamW lr=0.002, momentum=0.9)
#       Only weight_decay, box, and mosaic were effectively tuned

model: yolo11s.pt
epochs: 100
imgsz: 640
batch: 16

# Tuned parameters
weight_decay: 0.001
box: 6.22111
mosaic: 1.0

# These were in the search space but overridden by optimizer=auto
# To actually tune these, set optimizer: SGD explicitly
# lr0: 0.03529
# momentum: 0.98

# Results (test set):
# Precision: 86.7%, Recall: 89.2%, mAP50: 92.2%, mAP50-95: 63.5%
# Inference: 1.2ms/image (RTX 4090)
