# YOLOv11l hyperparameters
# Using same tuned values as Small for fair A/B comparison
# These were tuned on Small model - may not be optimal for Large
# Date: 2025-02-20

model: yolo11l.pt
epochs: 100
imgsz: 640
batch: 16  # May need to reduce to 8 if VRAM is tight

# Same tuned parameters as Small (for fair comparison)
weight_decay: 0.001
box: 6.22111
mosaic: 1.0

# Deployment target: Jetson Orin Nano 8GB
# Key concern: model size and inference speed after TensorRT quantization
# YOLOv11l has ~25.3M params vs 9.4M for Small (~2.7x more)

# Results: [pending]
